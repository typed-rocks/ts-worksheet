## Settings

You can enable the output of variables by using `//ts-worksheet-with-variables` instead of `//ts-worksheet`. 

Also just check the settings of the plugin to change the colors of the inlays and the node-path.

## Usage

After installation, follow these simple steps to use the plugin:

1. Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file.
2. Add `//ts-worksheet` or `//ts-worksheet-with-variables` at the top of the file.
3. Start coding and save the file when you are ready! You'll see the output of your code directly in the editor.
